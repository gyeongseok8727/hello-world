# hello-world
First repository

I know how to write code in C. I'm not pro and just code to chill. Coding is my hobby.
These days I am learning Python and I will upload the program that I creat on github from now on.
Maybe this github would be my portfolio later on.
I want to make an artificial intelligence like jarvis in ironman movie.
